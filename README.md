# Recipe Application

## Overview

The Recipe App is a full-stack web application built with Python-based Django that allows users to create, read, and modify their own content, and search for recipes based on ingredients. Users can also view statistical dashboards based on data analytics. The application is deployed through PythonAnywhere, with a SQLite database at the backend and HTML/CSS-based rendered pages at the frontend.
